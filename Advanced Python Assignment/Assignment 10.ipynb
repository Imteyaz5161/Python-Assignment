    "__Ans:__ __`getattribute`__ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError if it fails to find an attribute of a class. __`getattr`__ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by __`getattribute`__, but for this __`getattribute`__ and __`getattr`__ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, __`getattr`__ returns a default value. So key difference is that __`getattr`__ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class."
